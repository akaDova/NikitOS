# NikitOS
Simple DOS-like operating system based on FAT12 file system, completely written in x86 assembly & compiled by FASM.
Can execute COM files (also known as MS-DOS apps).

FAT12fs.imp is a image disk of floppy drive whith FAT12 file system. For use NikitOS you should run this image on your virtual machine (like VMWare, Virtual Box, Bochs). Also you can write on floppy drive this image and run it on hardware (I've successfully tried it at a real hardware).
